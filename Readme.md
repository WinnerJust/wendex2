# WEndex.taxi v2.0

## Description

WEndex.taxi for Windows only

Consists of:

1. Server side
2. Sample client side
    1. Console app for passengers/drivers
    2. Console app for admin

## Installation

You will need to build the program from source code.

In order to run the program you need to provide a database. Or you can use the sample `app/db.json`

Make sure to follow the name convention and the structure:

```cpp
{
   "speed":0.1,
   "parkRightInFrontOfTheEntrancePrice":300,
   "freeBottleOfWaterPrice":100,
   "prices":[
      {
         "name":"(E)conomy",
         "price":1000
      },
      {
         "name":"(C)omfort",
         "price":1500
      },
      {
         "name":"Comfort(+)",
         "price":1700
      },
      {
         "name":"(B)usiness",
         "price":4000
      }
   ],
   "cities":{
      "Challenge-Brownsville":{
         "latitude":39.46447,
         "longitude":-121.26338
      },
      "Florence-Graham":{
         "latitude":33.96772,
         "longitude":-118.24438
      }
   }
}
```

## How to run

**System**

You should double check the correctness of the format of your database, then initialize the `System`:

```cpp
int main() {
	System system;

	return 0;
}
```

Now the `System` is ready to use.

**Console apps (for both passenger/driver app and admin app)**

You should have your System running to use the console app.

Initialize `GatewayWrapper` class passing the IP of the server to it.

If the Server and the Client are to be used on the same machine you can just pass `localhost`

```cpp
char IP[] = "localhost";
GatewayWrapper gatewayWrapper(IP);
```

The sample Console app uses second argument passed to it as the IP, so you can run it as:

```cpp
app.exe localhost
```

## Requests supported by the System

**signup** - creates a new account

**login** - authorizes a user

**orderRequest** - check the validity of source and destination cities
